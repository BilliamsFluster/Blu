# Blu
Blu is a game engine currently under development, designed to deepen my understanding of core game engine mechanics and improve my overall game development skills. By focusing on fundamental aspects such as event handling and graphics rendering, this project aims to enhance my proficiency in both game development and broader software engineering, leading to more efficient and effective solutions across various computing disciplines.

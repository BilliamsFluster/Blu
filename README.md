# Blu
Blu is an advanced game engine presently in its developmental phase. The primary impetus behind this initiative is to cultivate the essential skills integral to outstanding game development and enhance the understanding of the foundational mechanics that govern a game engine. The acquisition of these low-level competencies will not only provide a substantial edge in the field of game development, but will also foster a holistic proficiency in software engineering and computer science, thereby enabling greater efficiency and effectiveness across these disciplines.
